        "Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a type of machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks, which means predicting a continuous output variable based on input variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "In SVR, the goal is to find a hyperplane (or a higher dimensional plane ) that maximizes the margin between the predicted output values and the actual output values, while also minimizing the error between the predicted and actual values. The hyperplane is defined by a subset of the training data called support vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "SVR is often used in situations where there is a nolinear relationship between the input and output variables. To handle nonlinear relationships, SVR uses a kernel function to map the input variables into a higher-dimensional sapce where it is easier to find a hyperplane that separates the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, SVR is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can be sued for a variety of regression tasks, particularly when the relationship between input and output variables is nonlinear."
